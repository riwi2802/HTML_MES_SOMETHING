        <h2 class="headers">A Bit of Back Story</h2>
        <p>All my life I've been oddly enchanted by France- its culture, its language, its food, its works of art. So naturally, when it came time to choose a foreign language to study in middle school, I chose french. I studied french all throughout middle school and highschool, and eventually went on to get a minor in it in College. When graduation came around, I found myself with a degree in math that I wasn't too eager to use, and absolutely no desire to start my professional career, so I decided to pursue a program advertised to me by French professors in college : TAPIF. TAPIF stands for Teaching Assitant Program In France. TAPIF is a program ran by the French ministry of education where foreigners spend a school year aiding foreign language teachers in classrooms. The assitant works at most 20 hours a week in a high school (<i>un lyc&eacute;e</i>), middle school (<i>un coll&egrave;ge</i>), or an elementary school (<i>une &eacute;cole primaire</i>). So in September of 2019 I found myself on a plane flying away from everyone & and everything I've ever known or called home.   </p>

        <figcaption class="captionrow"><i>Map of Franche-Comt&eacute;</i></figcaption>
        <p>I arrived in Paris a day later but I was not quite to where I was going to be teaching. The ministry of education had placed me in a highschool called <i>le Lyc&eacute;e Victor B&eacute;rard</i> in a town called Morez. I still had to take a several trains to travel across about half the country, to a region in the east called Buorgogne-Franche Comt&eacute;. After about half of a day of traveling, I found myself in a very small burg of around 5,000 people nestled in a valley of the rolling hills that are the Jura Mountains, very close to the Swiss border. Morez was certainly not Paris. There was one grocery store, a highschool, a middle school, 4 or 5 restaurants, and a train station that had no more than 2 trains come through it a day. I could not be further away, literally and metaphorically, from the typical touristic experience that one dreams up in thinking about a trip to France.
         Most of the locals had never met an American before, let alone have one try to communicate with them in their own language with a funny accent. Lucky for me, this made me a sort of celebrity in the town I was in, and saved me from much of the brusque - ness that the French are notorious for.
        <p>I would say that for the most part I thrived. I befriended many of my fellow professors, and even some of my students (<i>le lyc&eacute;e</i> where I worked had a postgraduate vacational program - somewhat like a community college - so many of the students were around my age, if not older, thus it wasn't weird). I was invited to many a dinner party, bar outing, and restaurant outing. <i>Mes amis</i>(my friends) had taken me hiking, skiing, to various festivals. One of the most signifcant festivals I went to was <i>D&egrave;salpe</i>. <i>D&egrave;salpe</i> is a peculiar swiss festival celebrating the descent of the swiss cows from their mountain pastures of the Jura, to the central swiss plain. Theres lots of traditional swiss food and the playing of the alphorn, as well as music and dance, however the main attraction of the festival is the parading of the cows through the center of a small village. Every cow naturally wears a huge cow bell, so the parade creates an astounding cacaphony of ringing.<i>La Perc&eacute;e du Vin Jaune</i> is a festival celebrating <i>vin jaune</i>(literally means yellow wine), particular type of wine grown exclusively in the Jura region.
            The scenery of the Jura is strikingly picturesque (at least in the warmer months) with small mountains not unlike the appalachians and an abundance of greenery. Winter obviously brought colder weather, but unfortunately not much snow. It was cold dreary and rainy nearly every day.  </p>

        <h2 class="headers">My Travels While Living in Europe</h2>
        <p>While living in Europe, I naturally had to take advantage of the array of countries in close proximity and the dirt cheap flights, so I found myself traveling frequently. Due to the proximity of Switzerland, its wonderful public transportation, and the lack of things to do in my small mountain town, I found myself hitchhiking frequently to the French Swiss Border. It was from here that I was able to take a small train down into the central swiss plateau. I frequently went to Geneva, Laussane, and Nyon.
            One of my more significant travels while in Europe occured during my time off while my students were on "spring / easter break". I flew from Geneva to Dublin to spend a week traipsing around Ireland with my Aunt, Dad, and dog. I rented a car and, I'll have you know, driving on the "wrong" side of the road isn't as hard or unusual as it might seem. It was almost fun, except for the one time when I almost killed me and my family by driving on the right side of the road ( which was very much so the <i>wrong</i> side of the road in that country). Other adventures I went on included,         </p>

        <h2 class="headers">The Friends I Made</h2>
        <p>I made many friends while I was in France; here of some of the most significant:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Jean-Noel: optics teacher who took me under his wing perhaps because he wanted to practice his English (or perhaps because I was very eager to sample all sorts of fine French wines and liqours and even more eager to entertain at dinner parties)  </li>
            <li>Lola: Another optics teacher who was nice enough to loan me her car in the spring so I could really travel and explore the Jura </li>
            <li>Laura: a French literature teacher, who is exceptionally well traveled, and even more interesting </li>
            <li>J&eacute;r&eacute;my & Thibault: A French/Swiss couple that took me skiing and took me on several adventures in and around Geneva </li>
            <li>Am&eacute;lie: a friend of a friend of a friend who took me on a lovely tour of Aix-en-Provence and Alsace</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="headers">Takeaways</h2>
        <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">The intricacies of my time spent here vastly suprass the scope of this petite assignment. I could easily write a book about my time spent in France, recounting all the things I did and friends I made, and I could certainly write another unpacking all the cultural differences I noticed, from the minute peculiarites of speech patterns and linguistic nuances, to more larger overarching manner-of-thought differences. However, it seems that this never will come to be, as I am still processing the surrealness of the experience. Often times I wonder, "Did that really happen? Was it all just a dream?" Yes, it did really happen, and yes, for me, it certainly was a dream.</p>
